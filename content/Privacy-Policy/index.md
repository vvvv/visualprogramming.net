In case you reach us by email we will store your mails in order to process the request and in case of follow-up questions. We will not share any information without your consent.

## Your Data

All data we have about you is what you enter voluntarily to share with other members of the vvvv community. The sole purpose of allowing you to share information is to allow members of the community to get in touch with like-minded people on this website. We're not using your data for any other purposes.

The data is hosted on a server in germany. 

## Cookies

This website sets a session cookie to store some information for your convenience. This allows you to stay logged in over time.

We're not using those cookies for any kind of user tracking!

## Third party trackers

On some pages of this website you'll encounter embedded videos. In case of youtube those embeds are using the "extended privacy" mode for which google claims it will not phone home unless you actually play the video. In case of vimeo videos we are not aware of any specific "privacy" mode for their embeds at the time of this writing. Vimeo may therefore send data to their servers without your consent.

For analytics we're using [Plausible](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).
