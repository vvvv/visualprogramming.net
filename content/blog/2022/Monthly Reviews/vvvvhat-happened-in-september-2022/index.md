So you're wondering,

what we were up to in September?! Let me tell you all about it. But first you should know:

There is a **12-part vvvv gamma beginner course** starting on October 24th. If you're still not confident with vvvv gamma, this is for you: **[Details and Sign-up](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/vvvv-beginner-class-winter-2022-2023)**.

But now really, here's what we were up to:
* First, we added a feature to latest previews, that was long in the making: [Show & Tell](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/introducing-show-tell) let's you quickly share screenshots of what you are working on with the world
* Then we've added improvements for [Geometry Primitives](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/pull/561) also to latest previews
* Also the memory issue identified in [this forum post](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/total-frame-drop-out-including-audio-dropout-glitching/20701) was tackled successfully 
* All along we're polishing the upcoming 2022.5 preview release and have identified the following 3 killerfeatures for you:
  - Support for ImGui, a library for quickly building complex UI's
  - Export of console apps to plaforms other than windows
  - Improved support for writing C#, by allowing you to reference C# projects

So stick around and already prepare your friends and family that you'll need some time to digest those, once they are out...
