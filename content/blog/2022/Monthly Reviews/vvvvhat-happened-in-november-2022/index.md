As the year comes to a close, 

we have the new bug-fix [release 2021.4.12](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.4.html) out just now. This might be it for the 2021.4 line and from here on we'll further concentrate on polishing the [upcoming 2022.5 release](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/vvvv-gamma-2022.5-previews-available-now/).

Most prominently work this month has happened on the following:
* Adding Audio support for [VL.IO.NDI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.IO.NDI/), which we should be able to share soon for the 2022.5 previews
* "Create New... " Shader, C# Project... extensions [as demoed](https://youtu.be/m-tnhcX-n0k?t=2416) are improving
* Supporting the [Kairos Research Lab](https://opencollective.com/kairos-research-lab) to help them towards an initial release
* The long awaited node Inspektor is taking shape...

Oh and we had a meetup which you should watch if you haven't already: [19th vvvv worldwide meetup](https://youtu.be/m-tnhcX-n0k)
