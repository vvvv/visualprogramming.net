ladies and bois,

this is to announce yet another grande release of your favorite multipurpose toolkit that is vvvv. again we started out with a primary focus on bugfixing but along the way came up with some ideas..

so most importantly bug/fixwise:
* [boygrouping is back working as we knew it](/blog/2013/boygrouping-fixes)
* [vector join/split nodes got quite a speedbump](/blog/2013/new-vector-swizzle-nodes-and-vector-joinsplit-up-to-5x-faster)

and featurewise:
* there is [a new debugmode](/blog/2013/debugging-spreads): ctrl+F10 to see spreadcounts visualized
* there is a set of [sweet new vector swizzle nodes](/blog/2013/new-vector-swizzle-nodes-and-vector-joinsplit-up-to-5x-faster)

![](beta31.2.png)

also this release sees a fat drop of next generation girlpowers. please check your
 \girlpower\The Next Generation
to find an unprecedented collection of finely documented demos and overviews covering IO topics like: Arduino, Databases, DMX, Midi, Networking, TUIO and the Web. 

so they say vvvv is hard to learn? depends. they say vvvv lacks documentation? wrong. vvvvs documentation taskforce in the manifestation of {{< user "robotanton" >}} is unstoppable. much more to come... learning/teaching resources for vvvv are getting ready to play with the grownups. tweet that already!

and while we have you reading..please take a second to update your [personal settings](https://legacy.vvvv.org/home/settings/personal) with infos you'd like to share and then see the new [connections](https://legacy.vvvv.org/users/connections) page for some convenient listings. 

that is it for now. more changes to arrive in the alpha builds soon..
