halleluja, seems we did it again.

thanks for your patience, it has been a while since the last release. we've been hindered by the higher power of business but as yo shall see (in the [Change Log](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/core/change-log-vvvv40beta22.html) ), we have quite some goodies again. first we hope you notice all our tiny bugfixes that should result in an ovvvverall evvvven more stable impression. 

then we'd like to specially point out a quite nerdy new feature: multiboygrouping. ie, each client can now listen to any number of servers at once. while we'll still have to document this in the coming days you'll have to finally show us how to make use of this..

also there is this experimental FileStream2 (DShow9) node that you may be curious to test. nothing promised, but the idea is that it would switch files without choking. who believes in vvvv?

well and of course there is an addonpack again, stuffed with an extra 139(!) plugins contributed by woei, vux, fibo, chrismo and i guess some more (notetoself: organize a creditspage). 

and if i am not mistaken there is still more to come of this kind...

tsit for now, parents are screaming for attention. so please [help yourself](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads) and let us know about your findings.

happy nevvvv to you,
yours devvvvs.
