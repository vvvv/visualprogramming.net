only 29 days,

but still too many news and updates to follow. so here is a recap of the vvvv communities activities in february:

## Contributions

since a few days the download-counter is working again for contributions. sorry for the delay, we sure lost quite some counts for the statistics, but you know, everyone is so busy these days.. so whats been new last month?

* {{< user "darrelp" >}} gives to us a comprehensive set of {{< contribution "voronoi-with-winged-edge-information" "Voronoi" >}} plugins. All you ever wanted to know from voronoi, you'll find it there. 
* {{< user "mino" >}} is crazy, we already knew that. but his latest contribution tops the pops: {{< contribution "shadertoy-renderer" "Shadertoy Renderer" >}} takes a GLSL fragment shader with [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) syntax and returns a vvvv texture..
* {{< user "vjc4" >}} shared his {{< contribution "correct-tilted-360-images" "360° Panorama Correction" >}} module which he uses to fix images coming from a Ricoh Theta camera
* {{< user "antokhio" >}} added the materials for his {{< contribution "vvekend-vvorkshops-raymarching-basics" "Raymarching Basics" >}} vveekend vvorkshop
* {{< user "drehwurm" >}} uploaded his first contribution, a convenient module to work with the {{< contribution "akai-apc-mini-controller" "AKAI APC Mini Controller" >}}

* {{< user "woei" >}} updated his {{< contribution "scripter-(csharp)" "Scripter (CSharp" >}}) with a lot of nifty new features
* {{< user "tonfilm" >}} updated his {{< contribution "vvvv.audio-pack-alpha" "VAudio pack" >}} which now creates a generic userinterface for VST plugins that don't have their own

and if i'm interpreting [these](/blog/strong-typing-made-easy) [latest](/blog/generictest) screenshots correctly it seems as if {{< user "velcrome" >}} and {{< user "microdee" >}} have something cooking..

## Oldies but goldies

already more than 3 years old the {{< contribution "vvvv.packs.image" "CV.Image pack" >}} by {{< user "elliotwoods" >}} is still the one to choose when doing anything computer-vision. and it seems {{< user "sebl" >}} has a great addition to it in the making: looks like a spreadable input for uEye cameras..

## Gallery

many people are using vvvv for commercial work, which is great. only hardly anyone seems to bother posting their work in the [gallery](https://visualprogramming.net/#Showcase). because of course everyone is too busy. never mind, leaves more space for the arts:
* {{< user "rogalag" >}} just posted his [latest work](/blog/installation-review)
* {{< user "dominikkoller" >}} shared the latest update to his award-winning project [Visual Drumset](/blog/davidecks-drums-present-visualdrumset)
* {{< user "Junky_Inc" >}} [projectionmapped a weddingdress](/blog/wedding-dress-projection-mapping)
* the [Ars Electronica Futurelab](http://www.aec.at/futurelab) used vvvv for their latest [concert visualisation](http://www.aec.at/aeblog/2016/02/16/mothergoose/) in the Walt Disney Music Hall in Los Angeles
* [BadaBoom](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/badaboom.berlin) have created a [portable green box](http://badaboom.berlin/2016/01/15/portable-green-box/) they use with vvvv

and some people apparently are simply to lazy to post their stuff and i have to go dig it all out by myself. check this latest work by {{< user "sunep" >}}. best viewed on a large projection with speakers set to max:
{{< vimeo "129431563" >}}

also {{< user "tekcor" >}} sent in his latest work, a hybrid system of vvvv and vvvv.js. he writes: [MixBot](http://www.symbioticcube.com/MixBot) is a Web Audio API DJ mixer with advanced effects and logarithmic waveforms where vvvv on the server does the CMS creates the waveforms via VAudio and vvvv.js does the UI client-side.

## Education

{{< user "microdee" >}} organized another vveekend vvorkshop with {{< user "antokhio" >}} who gave an introduction to Raymarching. as usual you can watch them all in the [vveekend vvorkshops youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw).

and if you're free between april 12-16th come to <http://resonate.io> and join the 3 day intensive VL workshop with {{< user "gregsn" >}} and {{< user "elias" >}}.

## what the [VL](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/vl.html)?

it is amazing! i'm hoping to write a winter update before the end of winter.. ah and if you haven't already, check out the completely refurbished [Editing Framework](/blog/2016/introducing-the-editing-framework) we patched almost entirely in VL. available in latest [alphas](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews).
