- we updated the infos on [Coordinate Systems](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/basics/coordinate-systems/index.html) and [Using Addons](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/patching/using-addons.html)
- there is a shiny new page about [Curves](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/geometry/curves/curves.html)
- the flickr import is working again (posting to the vvvv group on flickr imports to the vvvv.org blog)
- contribution pages now show the category (plugin, module, effect, ...) in the topleft corner
- blog, forum and contributions got an introductory text

- {{< user "sunep" >}} did some [sobling](/blog/sobling)
- {{< user "evvvvil" >}} is fully immersed [live-generative-visuals-live-electronic-music](/blog/live-generative-visuals-live-electronic-music)

## Upcoming

this thursday i will assist {{< user "tonfilm" >}} in his [Rapid Prototyping for VR](/blog/2016/rapid-prototyping-for-vr-with-vvvv-retune-festival) workshop at the lovely [Retune](https://retune.de) festival in berlin. hope to see some of you there!

## What the VL?

oh glad you asked, big time! all is back on schedule. please first read our [vl-midsummer-nights-dream](/blog/2016/vl-midsummer-nights-dream) update and then: so you can now follow our daily progress again using the [alpha builds](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews) and we're very happy about feedback in the [alpha forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/) at this stage. 

we're now hoping for a beta35 release including VL as a first class patching language around new-years. all the bigger concepts are in place and we're now already giving them a second spin looking at ways to improve workflows for you (ie, spare you some clicks and the need to understand every technical detail to get things going). there'll be blog-posts with updates as we progress..

ovvvver and out. anything missing? please add it in the comments. have a good patch!
