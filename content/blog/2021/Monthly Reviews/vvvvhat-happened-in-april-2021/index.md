So what have we got?!

Releases: 
* There was a [vvvv gamma 2021.3.2](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.3.html) release and you can now [update your vvvv gamma licenses](/blog/2021/updating-vvvv-gamma-licenses) with a 20% discount
* And for [vvvv beta latest previews](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews) now include VL 2021.3 already as well

We're in full swing working [towards vvvv gamma 2021.4](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/roadmap/planned.html) and latest previews already include the promised [TextureFX](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/texturefx-3-0-preview/19429) and are shipping with VL.Video.MediaFoundation for super easy VideoIn and VideoPayer nodes! If all goes well, next up we'll merge the improved patching performance branch into the previews...
