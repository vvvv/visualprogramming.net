First off, 

there's been the [2020.2.5 release](/blog/vvvv-gamma-2020.2-release).

But now we finally also have a [Release Candidate for 2021.3](/blog/2021/vvvv-gamma-2021.3-release-candidate), the upcoming version including the shiny new 3d engine based on [Stride](http://stride3d.net/).

Even before this one is released you're asking what's next?! How on earth could vvvv be further improved? That's what we're planning to answer in a separate blog post soon.

Until then, let's hear it from the working groups:
