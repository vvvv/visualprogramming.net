It is out!

This past month we're happy to have released [vvvv gamma 2021.4](/blog/2022/vvvv-gamma-2021.4-release), the latest and greatest (so far). It took us much longer than originally planned, but probably that wasn't much of a surprise to many of you. Still, we're trying to get better with our predictions. So for the [freshly updated roadmap](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/roadmap/planned.html), we tried to be a bit more conservative for a start and rather update it along the way. But it should give you a perspective already for the coming year. 

Also, we tried to improve the [Features section on the website](https://visualprogramming.net/#Features) to hopefully give a better impression and overview of what makes vvvv. 

Then apologies for silently skipping the last two regularly scheduled meetups, but we now have a date announced: On December 7th, 8pm CET {{< user "baxtan" >}} the great will host **[The final meetup of 2021](/blog/2021/15.-vvvv-worldwide-meetup)** where everyone is invited to join and show us what you're working on.
