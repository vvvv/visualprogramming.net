What did you do in February?

Well, we did two releases:

* [vvvv gamma 2021.3](/blog/2021/vvvv-gamma-2021.3-release) including the shiny new 3D engine VL.Stride 
* [vvvv beta 41](/blog/2021/vvvv50beta41) including VL 2020.2.6

We're already working on a beta 42 which will include the latest VL 2021.3 and also the next bigger gamma 2021.4 which we'll talk about in a separate blogpost. 

We all met for [the 8th online meetup](https://youtu.be/jUBEyp-z3JI) and some of you also couldn't resist and once again made some great contributions:
