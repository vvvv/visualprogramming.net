Ohyeah!

This time of the month again. First off, for your calenders:

- September 7th: [The 13th vvvv online meetup](/blog/2021/13.-worldwide-vvvv-meetup)
- September 14th [Release Presentation: FUSE](https://thenodeinstitute.org/event/release-presentation-the-fuse-project/)
- September 28th: yet to be announced 14th vvvv meetup

Then, as the attentive among you have noticed, we've still not released the [long announced 2021.4 release](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/roadmap/planned.html). Frankly, we've been derailed a bit by commercial inquiries that made us shift priorities. And also the VL.Fuse team has been quite annoying in requesting some needed ground-work in VL.Stride... Apart from the delayed release, this is all good for you, because it also means some more new goodies. So rest assured, no time is wasted!

Things you may have missed:
* The NODE Institute has 2 of the recent workshops available as recordings:
** [Machine Learning for Interaction Designers](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/machine-learning-for-interaction-designers/)
** [Timeline your data using VL.Kairos](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/workshop-timeline-your-data-using-vl-kairos/)
* The [recording of the first VL.Fuse preview workshop](https://youtu.be/_NOZ3FLMD_I) is now available. While at it you may want to subscribe to their [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJP42j2ffyBQRPJyIOtQPbA)
