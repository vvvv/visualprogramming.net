When we've been approached by the [NOISE](https://www.noise.ist/) team and asked whether we wanted to run a vvvv workshop at their festival, we didn't have to think for long: 

We're happy to have Christoph Ignaz Kirmaier aka *chk*, co-founder of the Vienna and Berlin based studio [3e8](https://www.3e8.studio/) and [Rosi Grillmair](https://www.rgba.studio/) aka *remony*, artist, programmer and art- and culture mediator based in Linz to step in. They will run a 2-day vvvv and [FUSE](https://www.thefuselab.io/) workshop on September 13 and 14 which will be a perfect opportunity if you want to take your first steps with visual programming for interactive and immersive media. 

Get all details and tickets at the [**Noise_Media Art**](https://www.noise.ist/vienna) website!
