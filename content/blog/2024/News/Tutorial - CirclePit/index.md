We're happy to announce a new series of beginner video tutorials for which we joined forces with Christoph Kiermaier aka [chk](https://discourse.vvvv.org/u/chk/summary) of [Studio 3e8](https://3e8.studio/).

The videos are aiming at your curiousity to experiment and hope to inspire you to start working on your own ideas. Those will certainly spark further questions which you'll get answered in [the forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/vvvv-gamma/28) or [chat](https://matrix.to/#/#vvvv:matrix.org)!

So without further ado, here is Nr. 1:
