The year is half full again,

and we have something for you: **vvvv gamma 6.6** is out! Please [get it](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download), check [the change log](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/6.x.html) and [your license status](https://store.vvvv.org/orders)!

We're now also [officially supporting industrial cameras by The Imaging Source](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/introducing-support-for-the-imaging-sources-industrial-cameras/) which they were also happy to share [over at their blog](https://www.theimagingsource.com/en-us/resource/news/2024/06/26/).

## Learning vvvv

It's a good time for people who want to dive into vvvv:

* Beginners note: We've started a [new video tutorial series](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/new-vvvv-tutorial-circle-pit/)
* Everyone note: [The registration for LINK - the vvvv Summer Camp 2024 is now open](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/link-the-vvvv-summer-camp-24-registration-open/)
* And July comes with even more FUSE:
