Boom!

Multiple editor windows is your favorite missing feature? Go find a new one, because full multi-window and docking support has landed in latest previews. Still a few things to iron out here but you do already get the full picture. 

Also, work on the still not officially announced megafeature global channels is progressing nicely. Think storing, recalling and lerping between presets. Curious? Consult the help browser to see where it's at.

Both of the above, just a [preview download](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download) away for your testing pleasure...
