Apologies...

...for the delayed review. As you may have noticed we had a bit of summer going on lately. Most notably we had a very cozy time at [LINK24](https://link-summercamp.de/) together with a bunch of you. Once again thanks to everyone involved making these 4 days such a lovvvvely experience. Here is a little [LINK24 wrapup](/blog/2024/link-the-vvvv-summer-camp-24-wrapup/) of what happened there. 

Then there was [Ars Electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/) in Linz with [quite a vvvview things on display](/blog/2024/a-revvvview-of-ars-electronica-2024/)!

Meanwhile, in our ongoing quest to support more and more devices out-of-the-box, here are the most recent additions:
* [Support for hand-tracking devices by Ultraleap](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/introducing-support-for-new-ultraleap-devices/)
* [Support for industrial cameras by IDS Imaging](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/introducing-support-for-industrial-cameras-by-ids-imaging/)
