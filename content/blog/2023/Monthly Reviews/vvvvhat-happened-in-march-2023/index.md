Where's the time going?

We still missed to release our latest and greatest (vvvv gamma 5.0) this month. Some unfortunate delays as so often, but we're getting it in ever better shape, please bear with us just a bit more!

In the meantime, we ask for your input on workshops for [The Node Institute Summer Season 23](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/the-node-institute-summer-season-23/). Please join the conversations on the forum and let us know about [your requests and proposals](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/node-workshops-23/43)!

If you're only getting started with vvvv, consider taking this **[vvvv beginner class](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/vvvv-beginner-class-summer-2023/)** online course starting May 8th, run by chk of [3e8](https://3e8.studio).

As a teaser for the course, watch this great [playlist of video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2KeRstDQVRRVnzCHEambwAI4yWmpIF-p) introducing vvvv, starting with this gem:
