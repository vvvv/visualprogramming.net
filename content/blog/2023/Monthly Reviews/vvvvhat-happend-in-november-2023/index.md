//////////
Happy First Snow!

Since two weeks ago, every Thursday evening, there is an [intermediate workshop](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/node-institute-winter-season-23/24/) keeping us entertained, thanks to the [The NODE Institute](https://thenodeinstitute.org/ws23-vvvv-intermediates/) and the team!

Next on the list is [Introduction To FUSE](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-03-fuse-introduction/) it is free to join once you are registered.

There is a new goodie for the "Trackers" out there:
- [VL.Augmenta](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/introducing-augmenta/) - provides a plug & play solution for blob-tracking and analyzing pointclouds using inferared and depth cameras.
