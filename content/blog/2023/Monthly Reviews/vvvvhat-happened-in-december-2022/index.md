Happy new to you!

Another year has passed and with it, its final month of December which we are here to talk about. So here is what happened:

Are you into VR/AR? Then we have something for you: vvvv now [supports OpenXR](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/introducing-support-for-openxr/). In previews only still, but this paves the way for vvvv becoming a candidate for your next XR project.

If you always found [The Gray Book](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org) a bit hard to navigate, fret no more. We've added a fast and fuzzy search engine (search box in the top right corner) that will help you find answers to your question much more reliably.


But the biggest drop in December certainly was the **[Preview Release of Kairos](https://opencollective.com/kairos-research-lab/updates/christmas-2022-kairos-preview-release)**, the "framework for datacontrol and composition" (aka not-only-a-timeline) in heavy making which we've been happy to support since its inception. You can download and test it and/or watch the following in-depth introduction:

Then seriously consider supporting the further development via the [Kairos Research Lab open collective](https://opencollective.com/kairos-research-lab). You shall not regret it!

And save the date: Current plan for the next vvvv meetup is: January 19th. An extra announcement will follow.
