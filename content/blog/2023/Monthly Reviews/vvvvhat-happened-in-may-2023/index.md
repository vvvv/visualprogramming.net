Summertime!

And already we have a bugfix release for the 5.x branch. Please check out **[vvvv gamma 5.1](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/5.x.html)** which also casually introduces the new mega-feature of "Global Channels", which will be tremendously helpful when working on larger distributed installations. We'll have to talk more about those separately soon... 

The [vvvv Summer Season 2023 workshops](https://thenodeinstitute.org/vvvv-intermediates-summer-2023/) took a bit longer to manifest than we had hoped, but we finally have 4 upcoming workshops that you can now sign up for:

* June 22nd: [Soundreactive Graphics](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-08-soundreactive-graphics/)
* June 29th: [Working with REST APIs](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-13-working-with-rest-apis/)
* July 6th: [Game Logic](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-game-logic/)
* July 7th: [MiDi & Sequencing tools](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-15-midi-sequencing-tools/)

If you're looking for the previously announced workshops on FUSE, here is what the makers of FUSE have to say about them: 

*"As we want to be really sure to put in the needed time and effort for the 1.0 release to make it more accessible and welcoming we've postponed the FUSE Node Summer workshops in order to not be time bound to have it in place beforehand. This will allow us a more deliberate approach to community participation prior, including live Q&A sessions and collecting feedbacks, testing & propaganda."*

In the meantime it looks like there'll be **an open Q&A Session on June 7th, 7pm CET**. For details join the [VL.FUSE](https://matrix.to/#/#VL.Fuse:matrix.org) chat.

And if you missed the chance to take part in the [Sequencing values on a Timeline using the Kairos library](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-sequencing-values-on-a-timeline-using-the-kairos-library/) you can still sign up and watch the workshop's recording! Not sure yet if it will be for you? Check this preview:
