Dear patcher people!

Hope your new year is going as happy as ours. We're currently in full swing polishing the upcoming vvvv gamma 2022.5 release. No ETA yet but we don't have any big issues around anymore, mostly cleanup. One feature in particular that still needed a re-think for the new "precompiled by default" behavior was "Browsable Packages", see [this comment in the forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/cant-open-node/21063/11).

So please go ahead, [read about what's new](http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/vvvv-gamma-2022.5-previews-available-now/) and report if you find any issues with it. 

Note how one big new thing is the ability to export Console apps for running them on Linux. If this is your thing, make sure to read [Deploying to a Raspberry Pi](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/best-practice/raspberry-pi.html) to get you started.

And we had another juicy meetup just a few weeks ago. If you haven't had a chance to join, treat yourself to this recording of the 20th worldwide vvvv meetup:
