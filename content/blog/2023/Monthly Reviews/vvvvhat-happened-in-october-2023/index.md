Happy Autumn!

Grab a tea and make yourself comfortable while reading yourself through the happenings of last month...

Two new things:
- [Remoter 2.0](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/introducing-remoter-2.0/) - a standalone tool that let's you batch control a range of client PCs, useful for largescale installations
- [OSCQuery](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/introducing-support-for-the-oscquery-protocol/) - a node set to expose Channels from vvvv via the OSCQuery protocol
  
Then we're happy to see that **[FUSE](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Fuse/1.0.0-beta01) just had their first big beta release**. Congratulations to the team! And what a perfect timing for you to try it out and dive into [Nodevember](https://nodevember.io/):
