What's been the happenings?

Glad you aks! First off: Mid August saw the [2nd incarnation of the /blog/2019/link-summer-camp-slovakia-edition summercamp](/blog/2019/link-summer-camp-slovakia-edition). This time organized by {{< user "StiX" >}} near Bratislava. He wanted to write a little report of our activities there so I'm not gonna spoil it. Only wanna say so much: It was a blast! We cannot thank StiX and his friends enough, who did all the organization and prepared all the amazing food. Chapeau! And I wittnessed talks of possible future LINKs in france and spain. Let's see who gets this done first...

Then we just released a new [vvvv gamma preview](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) which finally includes nodes like the MultiFlipFlop, a Switch with multiple inputs, Resample nodes and more... Otherwise we're still polishing executable export and hope to be able to give you a preview of it soon. Besides that VL.Xenko is progressing quite well. More interesting for developers, read about how we [switched to Xenko.Math](/blog/2019/vl-switch-to-xenko-math) and a more popular one:
