We are very lucky to host the first vvvv gamma workshop at the Muthesius Kunsthochschule in Kiel. Joreg and Tebjan will give a 3 hour introduction into the vvvv future. Since we use vvvv a lot at the university, it makes totally sense to check out, what we can do with the next big thing.

There are still some seats left.

Where ? - Prototyping Lab, Werkstattgebäude
When ? - Thursday 18th of april, starting 2pm

In case you don't want to patch but just listen to what will come, you are invited to the evening presentation. The boys will give us a making-off presentation of Ocean Of Air, the first ever project realized with vvvv gamma and the upcoming Xenko 3d engine integration. (sentence stolen from the other news post ;)

Where ? -  mainbuilding,ZFM Medienseminarraum EG
When ? Thursday 18th of april, starting 7pm

See you there
