happy new patcherpeople,

## vvvv/vl

in case you haven't noticed, 2017 has passed without the release of beta36. booohh..i know, this wasn't our intention but you know, good things... and on the other hand you can say it is practically already there: please check our **[beta36 release candidate](/blog/2018/beta36-release-candidate)** and report your final findings!

among the new features in vl is a way to pause and step through frames as you can learn in: [One Frame at a Time](/blog/2017/vl-one-frame-at-a-time). find out about the many more changes in possibly the [longest changelog evvvver](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/index.html).

and if you didn't dare yet to touch vl, here is a soft way to get started: lean back and watch this series of videos to understand that using the basics of vl is quite similar to using vvvv, only that once you get there, it has so much more potential...

* [vl for vvvv users - Key differences](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-key-differences-1-5/15919)
* [vl for vvvv users - How to patch](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-how-to-patch-2-5/15948)
* [vl for vvvv users - Spreads vs. Spreading part 1](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-spreads-vs-spreading-pt-1-3-5/15956)

...still two more to come to cover only the absolute basics and get you up to speed. yes still no rendering of any sorts, but we're working on that...

regarding the promised major new feature of using .NET libraries, here is a quick example of using the [bulletsharp](http://andrestraks.github.io/BulletSharp/) physics library in vl without the need to write a single line of code: [Doing Bullet3d with vl](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/doing-bullet3d-with-vl/15916)
