dezember!

one week to go for the opening of [We live in an Ocean of Air](http://oceanofair.com/) which you normally wouldn't have to care about but in this special case, how this connects to you through this blogpost is, that this is the first fully [vl](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/vl.html) + [Xenko](/blog/2018/vl-xenko-3d-engine-update-1) project we've helped to realized. if you're in london between December 7th and January 20th, go see it, it is good, promised! if not, let's hope that everything goes well, because then the thing should go on tour and maybe come a bit closer to you.. here is a little teaser:

but that is not all:
* we also found time to prepare this [update for vl's 2d drawing library Skia](/blog/2018/vl-skia-update). 
* and if you're into history, checkout our newly built [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html).

next up: we're going to evaluate where we are with vl-standalone and xenko after this above mentioned project and we should have an update for you by the end of this year. and everybody yayy.
