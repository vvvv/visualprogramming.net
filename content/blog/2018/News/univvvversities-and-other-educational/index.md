helo teachers, tutors and students,

we'd like to assemble a list of your educational institutions that teach vvvv in order to:
- give people interested in vvvv an overview of opportunities
- be able to reach you with information about courses and workshops that could be interesting to students

for 7 years (i just checked my notes) we planned to build a system into the website (similar to the [businesses](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/)) where you could manage your own little profile of your institution. apparently that didn't happen...so let's try it the oldschool way. there are two ways to add your institution:

* go modify the wiki-page [Educational Institutions](https://legacy.vvvv.org/documentation/educational-institutions) yourself
* or send us an email to **edu at vvvv.org** and we'll fiddle with the wiki for you

in case you send an email please include the following information:
- name of institution
- website
- country, city
- notes
- contact (can simply be your username on vvvv.org or a link to a page at the institution with further information)

to give you an idea how the information will be presented, see this example:

See [Students showreel](http://showreel.fhstp.ac.at/tag/MOMP/) for examplary works|Matthias Husinsky {{< user "motzi" >}}


whenever you have an update, simply modify the wiki-page or send us another email. we'll also periodically send out an email to ask you to confirm your information is still valid, to keep the list up-to-date.

so if you're a teacher, please send us your information, if you're a student please ask your teacher to do so. if you know someone who should be on the list, please let them know about this.

thanks for spreading the word!
