so helo again, 

summertime...and we learn from google that you've been a bit more active on vvvv.org this year than compared to last summer:

*daily sessions on vvvv.org in july/august 2016 (orange) and 2017 (blue)*

good! though this may just be the weather or the aftermath of [NODE17](http://17.nodeforum.org/) still. speaking of which...the [schnellebuntebilder](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/schnellebuntebilder) have kept their promise and shared the [22 workshops they recorded at NODE](/blog/2017/node17-workshop-video-captures). alltogether those make for more than 60 hours of vvvv wisdom. thanksforthat!

in the vvvv/vl land we're still busily polishing the new importing feature for vl, as mentioned [previously](/blog/2017/vvvvhat-happened-in-july-2017). already looking vvvverygood but just still not ready for beta which should not keep you from testing it in latest [alphas](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews) already. a blog-post with a bit more details on the topic is pending..

also new in latest alphas is a [BarcodeReader (2d) node](/blog/barcodereader-%282d%29-help-directx-renderer) that can read a wide range of 1d and 2d barcodes and the very handy [new Tokenizer nodes](/blog/new-tokenizer-nodes%20).

on the documentation front we're making small progress behind the scenes and have added first screenshots to the gray book on [this page](https://vvvv.gitbooks.io/the-gray-book/content/en/reference/hde/navigatinga_project.html) and the following..

and without our intervention apparently [VL made its way to china](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RywbDJ35BqI).
