##  NODE17

Are you in post-node depression mode or haven't even been able to visit? Here is our full keynode we streamed live last week. It has a lot of goodies and should give a nice overview of what happened the past two years since NODE15. 

{{< youtube "BKHbEWaHjcw" >}}

Quite a few of the workshops were recorded, so those should also pop up at some point soon. And of course we'll also try to collect as many of the workshop materials again for posterity. Watch this blog for updates!

##  Education

If you weren't able to come to NODE this time here are three more chances this summer in Berlin to get a vvvv/vl treatment:

* [VVVV Summer Course](/blog/2017/summer-course-berlin) for beginners offered by {{< user "dominikKoller" >}}
* [VL Course](/blog/2017/vl-course-berlin) also offered by dominik
* [Parametric Design with Cardboard](/blog/2017/parametric-design-with-cardboard-in-vvvv) by {{< user "lasal" >}}

What next? The devvvvs are taking a bit of a break at the moment and will be back in full swing by the end of July. As announced at the keynode we'll then put finishing touches on the node/library import feature for vl. If you want to test it right now head over to the alpha downloads and get the x86 build (x64 is broken for now). Documentation and proper announcement-blog still to follow, obviously. 

And also our offer stands: if you have any library that you want to get into VL we are verymuch interested in helping you to succeed. Start a forum-thread to get in touch and let others know what you're working on so that we don't waste too much time with people working on the same things in parallel. 

Now I hear the lake calling..
