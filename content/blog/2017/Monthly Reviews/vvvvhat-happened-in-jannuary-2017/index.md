...and already 1/12 of 2017 has passed, but not idle! we first gave you the [numbers of 2016](/blog/2017/vvvv-in-numbers-2016) and then opened [the store](/blog/2017/introducing-the-store). devvvv-whise you got an intro to [networking and async patching with vl](/blog/2017/vl-networking-and-async) and an outlook on the [road ahead](/blog/2017/devvvvlopment-update-january-2017) plus our first 3 video-tutorials to get you started with vl:
* [Spreads vs Single Values](https://vimeo.com/197956686)
* [Custom Datatypes - think ParticleSystem](https://vimeo.com/198615170)
* [Some Basics](https://vimeo.com/200604809)

in latest [alphas](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews) you can also already enjoy these new gems:
* an example of how to patch multitouch in vl: **girlpower\VL\Animation\MultiTouch**
* new midi-file reader nodes: **MidiFile (Midi)** and **MidiTrack (Midi)** 

and then there've been a range of interesting forum-threads that got nice solutions with VL:
* [ConnectAll](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-first-go-connect-all/14614)
* [Differential Growth](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/differential-growth-patched-in-vl/14603)
* [Particles with Collision](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/custom-datatypes-think-particlesystem/14580)
* [Resample](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-resample/14622)
* [Recording Midi Notes](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/storing-midi-notes/14561)
* [Recording Values](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/scale-time-slow-motion/14641)

## The HAP Video Player Situation

for years this was high up on the wishlist of many vvvv users: a node that would play back [HAP](https://github.com/Vidvox/hap) video files. and suddenly there are two solutions on the horizon:
* github user arronsmith has shared a repository with a c# implementation 
* {{< user "lev" >}} is running a crowdfunding for a HAP video player node, see this forum thread: [Funding Hap video playback solution](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/decent-hap-playback-solution-for-vvvv-gpu-video-decoding/14663). in a move of cool the [m-box](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/m-box-bewegtbild-gmbh) people apparently made a financial contribution so that the crowdfunding now only needs to unlock the availability of the node for non-commercial use! see the thread for details..

must-watch of the month was the projections for the opening of the elbhilharmonie in hamburg with contributions by vvvv allstars [schnellebuntebilder](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/schnellebuntebilder), [quadrature](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/quadrature-goetz-neitsch-gbr), [intolight](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/intolight), [madhat](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/mad-hat-gmbh) and {{< user "lasal" >}}. here is a good [video summary of the event](https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/Die-Elbphilharmonie-in-Farbe-und-Licht-getaucht,illumination116.html).

restless {{< user "colorsound" >}} has nicely documented the three last works he made together with [CPP Studios](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/cpp-studios-gmbh): [zf-hda-table](/blog/zf-hda-table), [zf-ces-2016-concept-cockpit](/blog/zf-ces-2016-concept-cockpit) and [abb-–-yumi-automatica-2016](/blog/abb-–-yumi-automatica-2016)

and if you want to see something sick, here is what [nsynk](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/nsynk-gesellschaft-für-kunst-und-technik) have been working on: [a live AR show](https://youtu.be/75qzxi5LG-0?t=18m10s)
