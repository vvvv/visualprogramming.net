So once again, where were we...

oh, [NODE20 just happened](/blog/2020/this-was-node20) and never mind if you missed it, you can still [access the recordings of all workshops](/blog/2020/node20-workshop-recordings-online-survey)!

If you haven't noticed yet, the latest previews for vvvv gamma now include [VL.Stride](/blog/2020/vl.stride-for-evvvveryone), the fancy new 3d engine. We're quite happy with the feedback so far. Things mostly seem to work as expected. We're now focusing on making this preview into the first 2020.3 stable release including VL.Stride. But 3d is not all, we've also included a few other goodies in the 2020.3 branch, which are summarized in a separate blog post with the juicy title: [vvvv - The Tool](/blog/2020/vvvv-the-tool).

[vvvv gamma 2020.2](/blog/vvvv-gamma-2020.2-release) is out and also the latest [previews for beta41](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews) already include the 2020.2.x branch of VL!
