okok,

still no bigfat vvvv gamma release but we're now really getting close. See what we've just released last month:
* [vvvv gamma 2019.2-preview](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2019.2-preview) including executable export
* [updated licensing schema for vvvv gamma](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-licensing-2) valid from when we have the initial official release
* [updated Helpbrowser](/blog/2019/vl-getting-you-started) with overview of and easy access to all available documentation

This means we're now basically feature complete and are planning for an initial release in Q1.2020! More tweaks and fixes will happen for the export and we'll do some more work on the help browser to make it even more useful. Meanwhile please keep reporting your buggers and help us make this a solid first release. 

Documentation-wise there've been three updates: A new [Section on IOBoxes](https://vvvv.gitbooks.io/the-gray-book/content/en/reference/vl/ioboxes.html) in the gray book and two new how to videos: 
* [How To Use an Accumulator](https://youtu.be/ZOVOBxHHP00)
* [How To Manage Items in a Spread](https://youtu.be/KDMqj3TognI)

And the biggest news of all: **[NODE20 is happening!](/blog/2019/node-2020)** Just in time so that we'll have 3d-support in vvvv gamma and hopefully finally match most features of vvvv beta. Ideally we'll have at least a first version of VL.Xenko out before, so that some of you can even already prepare workshops with it... Curious about our progress there? Expect a separate blogpost with a wrap-up of latest developments shortly.
