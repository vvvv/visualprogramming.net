D'accord Paris,

while I'm in town for a [vvvv meetup on March 1st](/blog/2020/vvvv-meetup-in-paris) and a [presentation at Ircam on March 6th](/blog/2020/vvvv-at-ircam-forum-paris), I thought we could fit in some workshops. So together with local hero {{< user "sebescudie" >}} of [SUPERBIEN](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/superbien) we'll run two workshops. Here is for you to choose:

## Getting started with the all-new vvvv gamma

![](packingchars.png) 

Are you a creative coder, interaction designer, media artist, maker or scientist and want to add a new tool to your toolbox? Are you afraid of coding and want to try visual programming instead? Have you heard of vvvv before but never found the time to get started? Or are you just lazy and want to get your things done more efficiently? This workshop is for you!

vvvv is a visual programming environment that allows you to realize ideas involving things like 2d/3d animation, computer vision, MIDI, OSC, DMX, Kinect, Leap,... quickly without the need to write any code. But if you want, you can also write C# code for it and use any .NET library with it! 

In this 3 hour hands-on workshop we'll give you an idea of how it feels to work with vvvv. You'll learn the fundamentals that you need to be able to follow further workshops or take the next steps on your own.

When: Tuesday, March 3rd, 7pm-10pm
Where: SUPERBIEN - 14 rue Crespin du Gast (M Ménilmontant - Rue Saint Maur).
Signup: It is free but seats are limited, please signup via: ping@sebescudie.fr

## vvvv gamma for vvvv beta users

If you're a user of vvvv beta and want to up your game by learning about VL and moving on to vvvv gamma, this workshop is for you! Here we'll assume you're familiar with the terms of vvvv and know how to handle a 3 button mouse. 

We'll take you by the hand and try to convince you that VL and vvvv gamma are your best friends moving forward. You'll learn about the basics and benefits of using an object-oriented approach to solve certain problems and get an overview of all the improvements vvvv gamma offers over what you're used to with vvvv beta.
