regarding the question "who to support": the flattr button on the [downloads](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads) page supports the vvvv core team. otherwise every contribution and user page has flattr buttons. so simply flattr those whose contributions you like/use or whose answers in the forum are helpful to you. it really should be quite intuitive.

instead of thinking "who will i spend 10e" you just include someone in your flattring-club. and don't worry how much an individual gets. thats a common critizism of flattr but actually what makes it so easy as it takes those thoughts about specific sums away. i can only repeat: it is not about the sum, it is about the gesture. and the crowd will do the rest. SPAM also still seems to work..

in the beginning flattr had a way of doing bigger one-shot donations. they removed it years ago, but announced that it will come back. regarding the 10% fee i mentioned in the initial blog-post that with vvvv.org it is actually only 5%, vvvv gets the other 5% of all flattrs that are done via vvvv.org. 

"You have to go regularly on your flattr account to fill it.. " exactly not! you load up your flattr account with any amount you like and then set your monthly budget. when the account is empty it will inform you to load it up again. the procedure is really: load up the account -> subscribe -> forget -> receive a monthly report of your spendings by flattr. 

anyway thanks for trying and engaging with it. still hoping you and many more can be convinced to join in..
