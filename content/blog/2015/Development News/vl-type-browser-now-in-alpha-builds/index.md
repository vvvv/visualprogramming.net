The winner of the [VL feature voting](/blog/2015/vl-feature-voting) is now available in the [alpha builds](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews).

The type browser will assist you when annotating the type of a pad by providing an auto completion list with all types valid in the current scope.

So give it a test run and as always, report your findings in the [alpha forums](https://discourse.vvvv.org/).

happy typing,
your devvvvs
